# Core Math Library (OOP Implementation)

## Project Overview
This project is a modular **Core Math Library** designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Class Hierarchy**. 

The library allows users to perform various mathematical computations including arithmetic, geometry, and number analysis without writing redundant code.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (with error handling).
- **Geometry Calculations:** Circle Area, Rectangle Perimeter.
- **Number Analysis:** Prime Check, Factorial, Even/Odd Check.
- **OOP Design:** Uses a base class `MathOperation` for shared logic and derived classes for specific tasks.
